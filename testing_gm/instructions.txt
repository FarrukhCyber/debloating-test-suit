In testing.py, change the bin_files on line 16 list to your debloated binary names. Also add all your debloated binaries in this folder.
Run the python file using the command python3 testing.py
while the file is running, don't change the screen as the script is not saving the images, rather taking the screenshot of your screen and then comparing.
Also dont delete any file from this directory.
If it is failing on some case, try to increase the sleep_time to 2 secs in testing.py line no. 12
